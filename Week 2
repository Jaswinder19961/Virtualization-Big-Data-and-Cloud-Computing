We are now looking at cloud storage types: ie Block, Files, Object
There are several benefits of cloud Storage: Agility and Durability, Scalability, in-time capacity, cheapisty, no need to save on-prem
If we want to just store data, we can use s3 simple storage device that can be used for keeping private data or even for hosting webpages
If we need our current storage to be extended, we can use ebs: elastic block storage
Difference: S3 can be created and used from multiple availability zones, but ebs stays only in single az.
ebs is limited to ec2 instance  but S3 is not limited, and can be accessed remotely from anywhere.
S3 is object type and can only be used to store objects like static pages, logs, or anything metadata
EBS can be used to install operating, it works as a root volume where os resides in, that cannot happen with s3
Some free ka gyan: Free tier S3 gives free 100 buckets, 5gb each and only pay it exceeds the limits  
Now even storage has class just like humans: Standard for any permanent data-> 
Standard Infrequent Acess, for keeping backup data for 30 days, after 30 days moved to glacier ->
Glacier archives the data for 90 days, not cost for retention but for retrieval,...
Deep Glacier for 180 days retention also called double recharge
Intelligent tiering: can optimize cost as its very intelligent and optimise frequently accessed data
reduced redundancy: average non-intelligent tiering: it reduces the latency and that reduces cost but only good for non-important data
