Storage virtualization is a concept of software defined storage or Virtual SAN(Storage Area Netwrork). 
Basically, the SAN is a pool of physical storage arrays which are connected together and look like a single storage 
In short we are giving capabilities to lower-level storage
It covers 7 problems: Data Migration, Redundancy, Management, Vendor-Lock In, Scalability, Cost last but not the least ie Performance
Storage Architecture is matter if discussion as we have vital information stored and it has to untouched
Switch as we knoe is used to connect several devices on network, but router is connected to switch, so you can image how big of a network it can become.
way before multiple az, RAID were there that helped in saving data in multiple hdds and ssds.  RAID means redundant array of independent disk
Components of Storage Configuration are: UI Front-End, Master Node for control and communicate with Compute Node. 
Compute Node for calculations, File system for easy access on different location of clusters , Network with low latency and high bandwidth
Architectures of Storage: Multi-tiered, Clustered, Tighlty & Loosely Coupled, Distributed
Challenge: We are now in the world of data, Massive amount of diverse data coming from various channels and 
we need real-time data for analysis 
A DIKW model 1 is relationship between Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom. Each one represents a step towards higher level
In a certain event, Data with given Context becomes Information, Info with given meaning becomes knowledge, 
a knowledge with a given understaning becomes wisdom
But the real question ! why we need data? Answer is to be able to process and DIKW is the model to follow, 
A processed data is required for firther analysis, forecasting, and business analysis. 
A datgoes through following in DKIW model 3: Starting from Operation normal use PI-> Tactical something new KPI->
Strategic improvements CSF-> Now we here at wisdom further we do judgement, that helps in taking action and later we get expereince out of it
Types of Data: Structured means Tables , Unstructed means a google search page and Semi-Structured can be XML
EVerything comes under regulations, even for data we have compliance GDPR: General Data Protection Regulation has 7 rules:
>Collection of data should be for legitimate purposes, then the processing must be done legally, faily and be transparent way
>After processing , it should be stored and kept secure away from being stolen, damaged or lost.
Lastly keeping data updated

Moreover, the data is integrated from disparate sources and is distinguised based on data sources and consumers:
SOurces are DataWarehouse, Enterprise Application, Cloud SaaS application, BigData, Excel, XML and PDDF files
Consumers are user devices, BI, Reporting tools, again enterprise applications
Even data virtualization can be hybrid, we can keep our data on-premise and on cloud making it giving hybrid-cloud approach
