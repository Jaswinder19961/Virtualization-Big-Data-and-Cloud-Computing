Storage virtualization is a concept of software defined storage or Virtual SAN(Storage Area Netwrork). 
Basically, the SAN is a pool of physical storage arrays which are connected together and look like a single storage 
In short we are giving capabilities to lower-level storage
It covers 7 problems: Data Migration, Redundancy, Management, Vendor-Lock In, Scalability, Cost last but not the least ie Performance
Storage Architecture is matter if discussion as we have vital information stored and it has to untouched
Switch as we knoe is used to connect several devices on network, but router is connected to switch, so you can image how big of a network it can become.
way before multiple az, RAID were there that helped in saving data in multiple hdds and ssds.  RAID means redundant array of independent disk
Components of Storage Configuration are: UI Front-End, Master Node for control and communicate with Compute Node. 
Compute Node for calculations, File system for easy access on different location of clusters , Network with low latency and high bandwidth
Architectures of Storage: Multi-tiered, Clustered, Tighlty & Loosely Coupled, Distributed
Challenge: We are now in the world of data, Massive amount of diverse data coming from various channels and 
we need real-time data for analysis 
A DIKW model 1 is relationship between Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom. Each one represents a step towards higher level
